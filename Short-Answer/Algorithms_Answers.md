#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This would be O(n) //linear: The while loop only has one operation. 


b) This would be O(n^c) //quadratic time
    The algorithm increases the number of operations it performs as a quadratic function of the input size n. 
    The number of operations increases quickly.

    This would be like creating a family tree with different inherited traits. 
    It will get out of hand quickly and will quickly contain a lot of info and a lot of extra work with each additional branch. 


c) this would be O(n) //linear : 
    There is only one operation being run. 
    The algorithm increases the number of operations it performs as a linear function of the input size n. 

    The number of additional operations the algorithm needs to perform grows in direct proportion to the increase in input size n.
    This would be like adding pennies to a jar one at a time. The amount of time it takes to complete the operation is directly related to how many
    pennies there are to add to the jar.
